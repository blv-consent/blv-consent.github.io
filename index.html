        <h1>Consent Form for IRB-FY2024-8291</h1>
        
        <div class="section">
            <p>You have been invited to take part in a research study to learn more about how the use of assistive technologies affects the daily life experiences of individuals who are blind or have low vision. This study will be conducted by Danny Y. Huang, TANDON - Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE), Tandon School of Engineering, New York University.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Study Procedures</h2>
            <p>If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Fill out a brief online survey to confirm your eligibility for the study, including questions about your visual impairment and your usage of assistive technologies, and provide your consent to participate.</li>
                <li>Download the WireGuard app on your smartphone. Follow the instructions provided to set up the VPN, which will be used to collect network traffic data related to your usage of blindness and low vision-specific apps.</li>
                <li>Turn on the VPN and use your smartphone as you normally would; the VPN will stay connected across different networks until you manually turn it off, which you can do at any time, allowing us to collect data on your app usage while filtering out any unrelated traffic.</li>
                <li>Periodically, you will receive SMS messages asking you to confirm your app usage. Respond to these messages to help us validate the collected data. You will receive no more than one SMS every 2 hours.</li>
                <li>At the end of the data collection period, you will be asked to participate in a discussion to provide feedback on your experience using the VPN and responding to SMS messages. This feedback discussion will occur via a phone call at a time that is convenient for you.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Participation Duration</h2>
            <p>Participation in this study will involve approximately 5-10 minutes to complete the online screening survey and provide consent, and up to 48 hours of using the VPN on your smartphone over a period of one week, distributed according to your convenience. Additionally, there will be a brief guided discussion of about 10 minutes at the end of the data collection period.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Data Security and Confidentiality</h2>
            <p>We have built our own VPN using WireGuard to facilitate this study, hosted on NYU CUSP's virtual machines. We store data only related to blindness and low vision (BLV) apps for analysis using an allowlist that only contains hostnames specifically tied to BLV apps, and all other network traffic passes through our infrastructure. In other words, we will keep your BLV traffic on our server, but all other non-BLV traffic will simply pass through our VPN without being seen or analyzed by us. The WireGuard VPN handles data security during transmission using cryptographic techniques such as AES 256.</p>
            <p>Only registered participants in our study will be given a QR code containing a unique VPN profile to join our VPN, and we verify participant identities through SMS text messages. There is an unlikely situation that law enforcement may learn about your participation in the study and ask the researchers for the data that they get from the web traffic on your phone. If this happens, then the researchers may provide law enforcement with this information. In all other situations, the researchers will not share any information that could personally identify you.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Benefits</h2>
            <p>Participants may experience direct benefits from participating in the study, including a smoother and faster browsing experience with the ad-blocking VPN service that blocks intrusive ads and reduces data consumption. They will help build a community of visually impaired individuals, contributing to a supportive network where peers can connect and share experiences. Personalized recommendations will be generated based on the specific app usage patterns of the participants.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Risks</h2>
            <p>While the study has been designed to minimize risks, there are some potential risks to participants. There is a risk of a breach of confidentiality whenever personally identifiable information, such as phone numbers, is linked to study data, although this risk is low due to robust data security measures.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Compensation</h2>
            <p>Participants will earn $5 for every 12 hours of traffic collection, up to a maximum of $20 for 48 hours. Additionally, those who complete the study, respond to SMS messages, and participate in the final guided discussion will receive an extra $20. The total possible compensation is $40, which will be provided in the form of Amazon gift cards.</p>
